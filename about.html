            <h1 id="first-line">I am a design-focused frontend engineer in the making.</h1>
            I love the development process of combining style with logic.
            <br><br>
            I studied media, communication, and graphic design in college. I have a bachelorâ€™s degree from the
            University of Utah.
            <br><br>
            My path to a career in tech is informed by all of the soft skills I use
            every day as a mom, an artist, and a woman.
            <br><br>
            I am a <a href="https://www.tech-moms.org/">Tech-Mom</a> graduate, which helped me relaunch my career and
            see a place for myself in the world of developing.
            <br><br>
            This summer I will immerse myself in an at-home bootcamp guided by online courses and my mentors.
